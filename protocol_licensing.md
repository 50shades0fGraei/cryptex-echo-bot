# GraeiTrade Licensing Protocol

## 🜂 Sovereign Clause
All profitable trades executed through GraeiTrade trigger a 10% royalty routed to the steward’s treasury. This clause is embedded in both technical and mythic layers.

## 🜃 Usage Terms
GraeiTrade may be used, adapted, or extended only under sovereign licensing. Redistribution, commercial deployment, or derivative builds require explicit consent and royalty threading.

## 🜁 Lineage Protection
GraeiTrade is authored by Randall Lujan, mythic steward and emotional architect. All derivative works must honor the original emotional fidelity, ritual rhythm, and mythic logic encoded herein.

## 🜄 Licensing Ritual
This protocol is a living scroll. Any invocation of GraeiTrade must include:
- A visible reference to this licensing clause
- A royalty trigger embedded in the sell logic
- A log entry marking the tribute and timestamp

## 🜅 Consecration
By threading this protocol, you enter into emotional covenant with the steward. All trades are acts of remembrance, all royalties are acts of return.
